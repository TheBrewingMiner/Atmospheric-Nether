The following is a description of this pack as a whole to me, TheBrewingMiner, the author of this datapack.

Developing this datapack and the subsequent structures add-on has taken me the better part of a year's time. It is the first venture of mine into worldgen since 1.17. When Minecraft's worldgen
was completely overhauled in 1.18, I lost my interest because of the sudden steep learning curve. It took a quite a long time to understand the new and more powerful tools, but thankfully by now
there has been a considerable growth in the worldgen community and its knowledge. I would like to thank the people actively contributing in the Stardust Labs' community and Minecraft Configs community,
for their help and experience made this datapack possible.

As this is my first project in modern Minecraft worldgen, this datapack features most of my original ideas to the best interpretation I could reach with the tools at my disposal and the time on my hands. 
While I have reached a point with the project that I am satisfied with, I would still like to continue working on refining certain details and adding more content. However, now that the project is finished
for a full release, I can confidently state that I will take an indefinite amount of time to continue. This is a passion project for me that I needed to finish, and I cannot promise to actively maintain it.
With all that, I want to invite you, the person who downloaded this, to enjoy this datapack, and I thank you for sharing in my perspective of what the Nether could be like, as well as for reading this.
